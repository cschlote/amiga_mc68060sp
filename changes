Changes for Amiga Porting:
--------------------------

- Renamed Files to *.asm
- got some hassle with RCS -> short filenames
- Smake file added for SAS/C 6.5x
- Compiled and optimized ISP Package (with all tricks kept alive)
  (Rem: strange coding ...)
- Switch to HWGRCS because of filename size :-/

1.01: CHANGES SINCE LAST RELEASE 1.00:
--------------------------------------

1)
"movep"  emulation  where  data  was  being  read from memory was reading the
intermediate bytes.  Emulation now only reads the required bytes.

2)
"flogn",  "flog2",  and  "flog10"  of  "1" was setting the Inexact FPSR bit.
Emulation now does not set Inexact for this case.

3)
For  an  opclass three FP instruction where the effective addressing mode was
pre-decrement  or  post-increment  and the address register was A0 or A1, the
address  register  was  not being updated as a result of the operation.  This
has been corrected.

4) Beta 1.2 version had the following erratum:

	Scenario:
	---------
	If {i,d}mem_{read,write}_{byte,word,long}() returns a failing value to
        the 68060SP, the package ignores this  return value and continues with
	program execution as if it never received a failing value.

	Effect:
	-------
	For example, if a user executed "fsin.x ADDR,fp0" where ADDR should
	cause a "segmentation violation", the memory read requested by the 
	package should return a failing value to the package. Since the 
	package currently ignores this return value, the user program will 
	continue to the next instruction, and the result created in fp0 will 
	be undefined.

	Fix:
	----
	This has been fixed in the current release.

	Notes:
	------
	Upon receiving a non-zero (failing) return value from a
	{i,d}mem_{read,write}_{byte,word,long}() "call-out",
	the package creates a 16-byte access error stack frame from the current
	exception stack frame and exits through the "call-out" _real_access().
	This is the process as described in the MC68060 User's Manual.

	For instruction read access errors, the info stacked is:
		SR 	= SR at time of exception
		PC 	= PC of instruction being emulated
		VOFF	= $4008 (stack frame format type)
		ADDRESS	= PC of instruction being emulated
		FSLW	= FAULT STATUS LONGWORD

	The valid FSLW bits are:
		bit 27 		= 1	(misaligned bit)
		bit 24 		= 1	(read)
		bit 23 		= 0	(write)
		bit 22:21	= 10	(SIZE = word)
		bit 20:19	= 00	(TT)
		bit 18:16	= x10	(TM; x = 1 for supervisor mode)
		bit 15		= 1	(IO)
		bit 0		= 1	(Software Emulation Error)

	all other bits are EQUAL TO ZERO and can be set by the _real_access()
	"call-out" stub by the user as appropriate. The MC68060 User's Manual
	stated that ONLY "bit 0" would be set. The 060SP attempts to set a few
	other bits.

	For data read/write access errors, the info stacked is:
		SR 	= SR at time of exception
		PC 	= PC of instruction being emulated
		VOFF	= $4008 (stack frame format type)
		ADDRESS	= Address of source or destination operand
		FSLW	= FAULT STATUS LONGWORD

	The valid FSLW bits are:
		bit 27 		= 0	(misaligned bit)
		bit 24 		= x	(read; 1 if read, 0 if write)
		bit 23		= x	(write; 1 if write, 0 if read)
		bit 22:21	= xx	(SIZE; see MC68060 User's Manual)
		bit 20:19	= 00	(TT)
		bit 18:16	= x01	(TM; x = 1 for supervisor mode)
		bit 15		= 0	(IO)
		bit 0		= 1	(Software Emulation Error)

	all other bits are EQUAL TO ZERO and can be set by the _real_access()
	"call-out" stub by the user as appropriate. The MC68060 User's Manual
	stated that ONLY "bit 0" would be set. The 060SP attempts to set a few
	other bits.
